            <h1>Front-end and Design</h1>
            <p>Embracing the tenet that a sophisticated user experience and user interface (UI/UX) can be pivotal to the
              success or failure of a mobile application product. In our visually driven world, oftentimes, UX/UI is the main
              distinction in products of different companies. “It is not enough that we build products that function, that
              are understandable and usable, we also need to build products that bring joy and excitement, pleasure and
              fun, and yes, beauty to people’s lives.” This quote from Donald A. Norman (Allanwood and Beare, 2014, p.14)
              rings true to humans attaching emotion to a product. In this instance, an emotionally geared, well-designed
              UX/UI can grant a company competitive advantage and growth in the mobile applications market (Philips,
              2017).<br><br>
              Highlighting the importance of UX/UI design, it is obvious that priority needs to be placed on the quality of
              software and hardware tools needed to produce a beautiful design. The tools needed will be specified as
              programming languages, tools, software and lastly, hardware and peripherals
            </p>
            <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
            <!--HTML BEGINS-->
            <h3>HTML5 (Hypertext Mark-Up Language) (Vicente, 2021) - <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank">Link</a></h3>
            <ol>
              <li>HTML5 is used to create pages for web-browsers to display by retrieving a HTML file stored in a
                server. It is then parsed to display a webpage as intended by the instructions written in the HTML
                file.</li>
              <li>In the context of the development of Hex Clan’s Budget Hub application, HTML is used to achieve
                the desired structure of pages consisting of a series of elements agreed upon in the design and
                planning stage.</li>

              <li>JavaScript is a scripting language used to build and manipulate dynamic site content. Features such

            <h2>Further Tools</h2>
            <p>The following UI tools have and will be used in the case of a web application, although the application that Hex Clan seeks to deliver, is a native one.</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>

            <h4>JSON (Javascript Object Notation) (Balagun, 2021) - <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>JSON allows frontend and backend code to work synergistically, smoothening the data transferring back and forth.</li>
              <li>For example, further development of the Budget Hub application would require the adoption of more libraries,
                backend technology and incorporation of other libraries. Using JSON could help data interchange.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) (Morris, n.d.) - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Ajax is a set of development techniques that is used for developing websites and applications. Its main function is to update content
                asynchronously, meaning only parts of the content is reloaded while the rest stays static.</li>
              <li>For example, in the Budget Hub application, price changes for groceries can change over time.
                The price changes can be reflected in the content while the user is browsing shops for groceries.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Frameworks and Libraries</h3>

            <h4>Angular v13.0.0 (Codecademy, 2021) - <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Angular is a frontend framework which makes developing and maintaining frontend applications faster and
                simpler by providing structured and recyclable code and components.</li>
              <li>For example, Angular can be used to increase performance in the source code of the development project.
                Using Angular will also promote consistent code and simplicity when creating, by using Angular’s declarative templates.
                Another benefit is it is a widely supported framework, which is included in many code editors and IDEs.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>React Native Version 0.66 (Codecademy, 2021b) - <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>React Native is an open-sourced framework that is used predominantly in mobile development.
                With React Native, hybrid applications that run on Android and iOS systems can be developed. </li>
              <li>For example, the benefits of using React Native would be that our application, Budget Hub would
                look identical on either type of device (Apple or Android), or the UI would remain consistent. With further
                development of this project, the Budget Hub application will be more widely circulated and available on more
                devices for financial growth.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>jQuery v3.6.0 (Pung, 2017) -  <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>jQuery is a popular JavaScript library for front-end development. Furthering the development of the application,
                jQuery plugins built on top of the framework could add further functionality to the application.</li>
              <li>For example, content could be arranged in a neater way using a plugin called matchHeight which could
                create blocks of content of equal height dynamically. Another example would be to use a SlickSlider plugin
                for sliders, responsive choices, and infinite looping. </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Bootstrap v3.4.1 (Turner, 2021) - <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Bootstrap is an entirely customizable framework with a massive open-sourced library of design templates
                based on CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The benefits of using Bootstrap are the responsiveness, quality added to
                applications and web content. </li>
              <li>For example, using Bootstrap would allow for rapid UI development of the Budget Hub application.
                 Apart from that, Bootstrap also requires a lower learning curve.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Languages</h3>

            <h4>TypeScript 4.4 (Lease, 2018) - <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which gives the developer more control via type annotations,
                interfaces, and classes. It was created to ease the development of larger scaled applications as well as improve
                JavaScript code by catching errors during code compilation time more readily.</li>
              <li>For example, as the project grows, it would be prudent to use TypeScript to improve workflow process.
                Errors can be caught with less time by using TypeScript.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Dart SASS 1.43.4 with SCSS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets/Sassy CSS)(Agrawal, 2021) - <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Link</a></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>SASS with SCSS can be used instead of CSS as the development of the application grows as regular CSS
                becomes hard to maintain with the drawn-out code. </li>
              <li>For example, SASS and SCSS allows features such as modularity, inheritance, conditionals, looping,
                nesting, and mix-ins to make CSS easy to maintain. </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Mobile Development</h3>
            <h4>SwiftUI 5.5.1 (Jacobs 2021) - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">Link</a></h4>
            <p>Swift UI is a platform that follows multiple concepts and provides numerous services that are found in UIKit and AppKit.
              It holds multiple useful tools including “lists, stacks, buttons, pickers, and many more” (Jacobs, 2021). An essential aspect
              to this framework is that it is completely integrated into XCode. This does not only exponentially grow the efficiency of the
              development process but decreases any chance of miscommunication and mishaps between platforms. The ability to run the code from
              XCode and being able to see and preview the code you have just edited, is spoken of as an almost essential feature and one that is
              “more than a nice to have feature,” as the lack of necessity to run the code on a simulator or device leads to far more efficient
              programming. Another spectacular feature, that may not be useful in this application, is the cross-platform framework, that allows
              whatever UI you are using, to be used on multiple platforms " including macOS”. Despite the platform a frontend developer is targeting,
              the foundation remains immutable. As mentioned previously, said features shall be of great assistance to the development of the frontend
              of this application. As the Hex Clan intend on using this UI framework to develop the IOS native application, these visual aspects may be
              custom coded, or, built in default tools may be used. Hex Clan would require a developer that can custom code the UI and use as little
              built in default tools as possible.</p>
            <h4>JavaFX 16 (Staff Writers n.d.) - <a href="https://openjfx.io/">Link</a></h4>
            <p>JavaFX is an open-source platform that enables developers to build spectacular looking desktop and mobile UI’s. A testFX software
              is built into this kit that would allow programmers to run their code efficiently and accurately, thus being able to conduct and
              examine inputs and application behaviours efficiently and effortlessly. This UI kit will be essential to the building of the android
              application as the backend is only competent at storing data and displaying and receiving information through the console. JavaFX
              developers “rely on libraries such as Advanced Windowing Toolkit and Swing. After the advent of JavaFX, these Java programmers can
              now develop GUI applications effectively with rich content.” The syntax is written in Java, thus resulting in a higher collaboration
              rate between members within the team. </p>

            <h2>Prior Knowledge and Experience</h2>
            <p>The Hex Clan group members possess a varying amount of experience in
              frontend development and design tools. The following table displays the
              amount of experience each member has for the tools and technologies listed above:</p>
            <center><img src="../../images/tools_tech/frontendcompetencies.png"></center>
            <p>The table resembles the competencies of each team member regarding
              all the tools in this document. The Hex Clan have moderate skill in
              this domain and can complete simple tasks that require little to no
              cognitive ability and research, such as pushing to a GitHub repository and
              scripting HTML and CSS interfaces. While these skills may be used as the
              foundation and even the further development of a web application, they would
              in no way suffice to create a native one. As the main platforms required to
              create said application are SwiftUI and JavaFX, which in both, the team holds
              limited knowledge.</p>
