            <p>According to (Team Invonto 2020) an effective development plan for an app will span six phases.
            </p>
            <h4>Phase 1 – Strategy </h4>
            <p>In this phase you create and define your strategy that will allow you to evolve an idea into successful app. Through this phase you will:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify the target user of this app3
              </li>
              <li>Find and research the competitors in the market you are trying to penetrate  
              </li>
              <li>Solidify the app’s objectives and what goals you have for this app
              </li>
              <li>Decide on the platform and devices for your app to be on.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>(An average mobile app will cost around $150,000 to $200,000 to create with a production length from 4 to 6 months.)
            </p>
            <h4>Phase 2 – Analysis and Planning</h4>
            <p>In  this  phase  the  app  transcends  from  idea  into  an  actual  project.  This  phase  will  begin  with  defining  the  cases in which your app will be used and solidifying detailed functional requirements. Part of this phase will involve  gathering  the requirements needed for  your  development  of  the  app  and hiring the  development  team. This phase includes the planning of your app name which will involve the research of each app store to find if your app’s name is already in use.
            </p>
            <h4>Phase 3 – UI/UX Design</h4>
            <p>The success of an app in the modern crowded market is defined by how well the users adopt and benefit from the app's features, this not only includes a polished user interface (UI) design but nailing an intuitive user  experience (UX) and  ensuring  users’  stay  engaged  over  time.  Determining  the  data  displayed  by  the  mobile app, the data collected, user interactions with the app and the user journeys within the app, are the first steps of the design process. There are several design processes that occur during this phase:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Wireframes –</b> These are the digital form of sketches, conceptual layouts, otherwise referred to as low-fidelity mockups.
              </li>
              <li><b>Style Guide –</b> Following  a  style  guide  will  help  maintain  the  look  and  feel  of  your  app  and  ensure it remains consistent to your company’s brand image.
              </li>
              <li><b>Mock-ups –</b> These  are  high-fidelity  designs,  usually  the  final  renderings  of  the  app’s  visual  appearance.
              </li>
              <li><b>Prototype –</b> Prototypes are useful for giving the feel of the user experience and the app’s flow which will be expected from the finished product.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Phase 4 – App Development</h4>
            <p>Planning is still occurring during this phase of the process. Steps to take before development or programming occurs include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>the technical architecture will need to be defined.
              </li>
              <li>technology stack planned out and known.
              </li>
              <li>definitive milestones set out for developers to aim foremost.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Three integral parts are common with a typical app development project back-end/server technology, APIs and the mobile app front end.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Back end / Server Technology –</b> The database and any other server-side objects that will be required to support the functionalities of the app.
              </li>
              <li><b>API –</b>This is the method of communication from the app to the server/database.
              </li>
              <li><b>Mobile App Front-End –</b> This is the front-end native mobile app that the users will see and interact with.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Phase 5 – Testing</h4>
            <p>There is a large variety of testing and testing phases, performance through QA testing will occur to ensure the app is stable, usable, and secure throughout the development process. The standard testing that occurs through most app development processes include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>User  Experience  Testing  –</b> Ensuring  the  app  matches  the  original  designs  and  that it is consistent with the same theme throughout. This will be what end users experience when using the app.
              </li>
              <li><b>Functional Testing –</b> This should be performed by as many users as possible to catch as many bugs as the testers can find. This will help ensure the apps features are functional and minimal issues occur upon release.
              </li>
              <li><b>Performance  Testing  –</b>Testing  the  performance  of  your  app  will  lower  the  risk  of  bad  performance   issues   being   experienced   by   the   end   users   like   slow   loading   screens,   unresponsiveness and draining batteries of phones.
              </li>
              <li><b>Security   Testing   –</b> With   potential   vulnerabilities   leading   to security   exposure   such   as   being hacked; the  process  of  testing  security  should  be  taken  seriously.  While  making  sure  the  app is secure user ease of access should also be taken into consideration.
              </li>
              <li><b>Device and Platform Testing –</b> With devices coming in different shapes and sizes and with a variety  of  operating  systems  this  testing  needs  to  cover  all  the  devices  and  systems  you  plan on launching to.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Testing  the  app  before  launching  is  a  large  part  of  the app's success  or  failure  and  as  such  this  phase  is  a  substantial section of the overall mobile app development process helping deliver a quality mobile app.
            </p>
            <h4>Phase 6 – Deployment and Support</h4>
            <p>Will require the app to be submitted to stores with various data about the app which will then go through the review process, this process can take anywhere from few days to several weeks. Now that the users can obtain your app, constant monitoring of the app is required alongside frequent patches to improve the app.
            </p>
