            <p>As a group, one of the major limitations we experienced is lack of experience and knowledge, since, at the beginning  of  this  project,  none  of  the  group  members  had  never  developed  an  app  before.  With  determination  and  hours  of  research,  this  limitation  was  overcome, and  we  were  able  to  make  several  artefacts for both the user interface and back-end applications. As the scope of the app continued to grow, we  had  to  prioritise  and  focus  on  the  main  points  of  the  app.  Nine  main  functions,  which  we  focused  on,  were the comprehensive product list, web scraping, route planning, budgeting, history analysis, automatic html   generation,   user   interface   designing,   web   development   and   meal   planning   aspects   of   it.   Simultaneously, we had to leave out other  features  and  functions such  as  a desktop  application,  QR  code  integration and crypto currency creation.
            </p>
            <p>The first iteration of this app was a meal planning and budget control app, where people could find meals, be shown  the  ingredients  of  the  meals  and  the  prices  of  each  ingredient  as  well  as  the total  cost  of  creating  them. Once this data was provided, the user could then record their spending, to keep track of food costs with greater ease and were able to reduce their weekly budget. This was then expanded further to give the user the ability to use the route planning function, in order to make the commute to the shops as efficient as possible. In addition, we also expanded the product list from just food, to a plethora of different items sold by local stores, near the user.
            </p>
            <p>Despite our limited time together as a team, we have created a multitude of artefacts/prototypes. Some of these were made within our team’s time frame, and others are projected plans, to be updated throughout the app’s lifetime. Some of the artefacts that have been made include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Web Scrapers for a limited number of stores – These are able to supply our app with the database (product titles and prices) for users of this app. These will also be constantly expanded throughout the life span of this application, to include more areas and stores. Initially we have web scrapers for IGA, Woolworths and Foodland. It has been implemented by leveraging the Selenium framework.
              </li>
              <li>Web  development/User-Interface –  We  have  created  a  user  interface  which  allows  the  user  to  navigate   the   app/website.   The   information   in   the   app’s   database   is   limited   but   it   is   mostly viable and interactive, with most of the functionalities fully operational. The user will be able to navigate the app, looking up a range of items that certain stores have on sale and hence choose what items they wish to buy.
              </li>
              <li>Route-Planning – In our application we have also included a route planner, which optimizes the route the user should take, in order to expedite the shopping process. The route planner written in the back-end is fully functioning, allowing the user, once they have chosen which products to buy, to know the optimal route to complete their purchases. The application also displays the optimal route in which to visit the stores. Furthermore, the route planner in the website is also functional, despite the fact that due to the lack of a server, we couldn’t manage to have it work out the optimal route, in which the user should visit the stores. It was implemented, by leveraging Google Maps API.
              </li>
              <li> Back end – The back-end is fully functional, even though we have not included the barcode scanner functionality, since we do  not know  Java  and  it was  not feasible to  learn  it,  whilst  simultaneously  learning everything else necessary for the assignment within the given time frame.
              </li>
              <li>Budgeting – Through this application, before you go on your daily or weekly shopping trip, you will be able  to know  which  products  you  plan to  buy and  hence  are  less  likely  to  make  unnecessary  purchases (Caeser 2019)
              </li>
              <li>History analysis – In the back-end, the history analysis is fully functional, allowing the user to view the exact time and date, on which they completed previous purchases.
              </li>
              <li> Automatic  HTML  Generator  –  In  order  to  create  the  website,  due  to  its  immense  size,  it  was  imperative  to  create  automatic  HTML  generators.  These  generators  use  the  data  gathered  by  the  web scrapers and create HTML code based on it. The generators were written in python.
              </li>
              <li>User Interface designing – So as to make sure that the website was created in the most professional and organized manner conceivable, we created a series of graphical portrayals, depicting exactly how the   application   should   look,   something   which   we   adhered   to,   to   the   best   of   our   abilities <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmVV8WM=/">(https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmVV8WM=/)</a>
              </li>
