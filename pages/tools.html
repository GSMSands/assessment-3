            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The collaboration tools we have used to assist the team in completing the assessment include Microsoft Teams,
              GitHub, Microsoft Office Suite, Discord, and other various software. An accurate state of group efforts was
              reflected most in Microsoft Teams, as most collaboration efforts was done on this platform.</p>
            <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
            <h4>Group Chat</h4>
            <p>The team felt it was best if the bulk of the daily messages and informal information be done in Microsoft Teams group chat,
              as it was easier to converse as there are significant physical distance and time difference between team members. Due to
              the nature of Microsoft Teams group chat, the team was unable to export the history of the group chat.</p>
            <h4>Channels in the ‘Hex Clan A3’ team</h4>
            <p>In the team, multiple channels were created to organise each section of the assessment for the purpose of uncomplicated access and organisation exercise.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>General</b> - This channel was used to discuss initial team set-up decisions and for everything that falls in the ‘general’
                criteria of the assessment. The ‘Kanban Board A3’ tab within it contained the team’s Kanban board. The ‘Files’
                tab contained general timeframe information initially used for team organization and other files including
                the team’s A2 files and the team’s logo.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Team Profile</b> - This channel was created to contain discussions and files related to the ‘team profile’ part of
                the assessment. The ‘Files’ tab contained all the required documents that related to the team profile criteria of the assessment.</li>
              <li><b>Tools</b> - This channel was created to contain discussions and files related to the ‘tools’ that were used in creating
                this assessment. It was not very active due to this documentation could only be executed and completed towards the
                end of the assignment. The ‘Files’ tab contains the tools documentation.</li>
              <li><b>Project Plan</b> - This channel was created to allow discussions, collaborations and creation of documents relating to the
                project idea. As this is the largest part of the assessment, this channel was the most active as it contains many documents
                to create the Budget Hub application. The ‘Files’ tab within it contained a broken-down structure of the project plan which
                the team derived from the assessment criteria.</li>
              <li><b>Skills and Jobs</b> - This channel was created to discuss and work on various skills and jobs that will be required to work
                on the Budget Hub application. In the ‘Files’ tab, created ‘job advertisements and descriptions’ were created as part
                of the requirement for assessment 3.</li>
              <li><b>Group Reflection</b> - This channel’s purpose was to organise the team’s reflections towards the end of this assessment.
                In the ‘Files’ tab, a personal reflection collaboration document was created as well as a group reflection document.</li>
              <li><b>Final Documents for PDF</b> - This channel was created to discuss and contain the final documents for the assessment 3 submission.</li>
              <li><b>GitHub Repository (Presentation)</b> - This channel’s purpose was to discuss and contain files and documents relating
                to the creation assessment 3 website and GitHub repository. It was not well used as the team preferred to upload their documents to GitHub directly.</li>
              <li><b>Project Management</b> - This channel includes all the necessary files and discussion relating to project management of this
                assessment. It also contains a Master Task List which helps the team visualise the whole progress of the assessment.</li>
              <li><b>Artefacts</b> - This channel was created to discuss and inform the team of the progress on the Budget Hub prototype.
                The ‘Files’ tab included all the necessary code and files relating to the Budget Hub application.</li>
              <li><b>9A Presentation</b> - This channel was created to discuss the presentation which was the requirements of Assessment 5.
                The discussions within this channel enabled collaboration in the presentation collaboration regardless of the physical
                distance that exist. Each team member uploaded their videos which was combined by another talented team member to make up
                the whole of the presentation submission.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Meetings</b> - This channel was created to manage all the meetings the team had in relation to this assessment.
                In the ‘Files’ tab, contains all the actions and agendas, recordings, and other documentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Tools within Microsoft Teams</h4>
            <p>Several tools that exist within Microsoft Teams was used to facilitate the creation of the assessment 3. The following tools are listed below:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Polly</b> - This was utilised to obtain a consensus on minor decisions to be made including the team’s name and logo creation.</li>
              <li><b>Tasks by Planner and To Do</b> - A Kanban board was created to organise tasks in the team, this helped the team keep track of
                their tasks and deadlines as well as helped the team visualise the number of tickets each team member has, to avoid
                overloading a team member with too many tickets. This enabled the team to distribute tasks fairly and evenly.</li>
              <li><b>SharePoint</b> - This application was used to share documents between team members to allow easier collaboration.
                This is a useful innovation above emailing team member’s document.</li>
              <li><b>Microsoft Excel</b> - This application was used to create graphs and tables for the purpose of data analysis which
                was used in various parts of the assessment.</li>
              <li><b>Microsoft Word</b> - This application was used in all the document creation relating to the written parts of the assessment.</li>
              <li><b>Chat</b> - As mentioned above, this feature was used for general communication purposes, to update each
                other on work progress as well as general wellbeing checks and banter. The reason chat was used over channel
                communication was because of the nature of the team members being more active, the channel post history is
                lengthy and difficult to keep track of.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Microsoft Teams Analytics</h4>
            <p>The Teams channel analytics can be found in the following path:</p>
            <i>Hex Clan A3 -> Manage Team -> Analytics</i>
            <p>The period for this analysis was between <b>16/10/2021 - 14/11/2021</b>, which was the ‘Last 30 Days’ from the point
              of making this documentation. This period falls in the assessment period which was suitable for this analysis.</p>
            <img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools1.png"><br>
            <p>1. <b>Summary</b></p>
            <p>From the screenshot, it is observed that there were <b>9 users</b>. This can be explained by the team
              inviting their tutors and course coordinator to the team to observe our progress and for the purpose of grading.
              In fact, only <b>5 team members</b> were truly active in this team. A total of <b>8 applications</b> were either explored or used,
              <b>7 meetings</b> were held, and the team shared a total of <b>7.83GB</b> worth of files and documents.</p>
              <img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools2.png">
            <p>2. <b>Engagement</b></p>
            <ol type="I">
              <li>The following screenshot demonstrates that 95 posts were created in all the channels which illicit a total of 240 replies.
                A total of 113 mentions were made to prompt team member responses and 116 reactions were given in response
                to posts or replies. This exhibits a high degree of participation by team members.</li>
              <center><img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools3.png"></center>
              <li>This graph illustrates the engagement between team members in the Teams channels. It shows that team members were
                consistently communicating and engaging in the entire course of this assessment.</li>
              <center><img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools4.png"></center>
            </ol>
            <p>3. <b>Users</b></p>
            <p>From this graph below, it is observed that the number of active users increased exponentially on the 19th of October 2021,
              this is due to the formation of the team at the start of the assessment, as team members were from other teams in assessment 2,
              a new Teams group was made for assessment 3. The number of active users were consistent throughout the assessment period.</p>
            <img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools5.png">
            <p>4. <b>Tasks</b></p>
            <p>The team attempted to adopt agile methodologies to our approach in project planning. Therefore, a Kanban board was
              used for this assessment as it helps the team members practise agile methodology skills to benefit them in their
              future careers. The reasoning for the usage of Kanban is that software is generally developed in a long cycle, cards
              or tickets which are moved are used throughout the entire process. Kanban is not iterative but incremental, as most
              tasks do not have specific start and endpoints. Each project section or task have ‘WIP’ (Work in Progress) limits,
              assisting team members to focus on a small part of the project at any given time (Goyal 2020).</p>
            <ol type="I">
              <li>The board view below demonstrates the team’s effort in adopting these methodologies.</li>
              <center><img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools6.png"></center>
              <li>The pie chart in ‘Chart’ view shows the status of the tasks in the Kanban board. As of 16th of November 2021,
                there are 2 tasks not started, 6 in progress, 0 late tasks, and 159 completed tasks. The team showed great enthusiasm
                in keeping the deadlines and completing tasks to a high standard.</li>
              <center><img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools7.png"></center>
              <li>This bar chart shows the tasks completed by individual members. The graph does not represent the amount of
                work each team member completed due to the task assignment system not considering the bulk and duration needed
                for each task. For this reason, some tasks require less effort than others. However, the number of tasks completed
                by team members for this assessment is significant. Earlier in the assessment, a student dropped out of the team
                due to illness, therefore, his tasks which were completed were significantly lesser than the other team members.
                The team also invited their tutors and course coordinator to the Teams group for grading purposes.</li>
              <center><img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools8.png"></center>
            </ol>
            <h3>Master Task List</h3>
            <p>A master task list was also used to keep track of the progress of each section of the assessment. The table below demonstrates this:</p>
            <img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools9.png">
            <h3>GitHub</h3>
            <p>The team used GitHub for two purposes, to store code for the team’s website and to store the code for the Budget Hub application.</p>
            <h4>A3 GitHub Repository Pulse</h4>
            <p>Link: <a href="https://github.com/GSMSands/assessment-3/pulse/monthly" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p>
            <img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools10.png">
            <p>The period chosen for the insights represent the entire assessment period length. From the screenshot above, it is observed
              that excluding merges, 5 authors have pushed 100 commits to the main branch of the project. As all branches are currently even
              with main, there are no changed files, additions, or deletions.</p>
            <h4>Contributions</h4>
            <p>The following graphs show the aggregate number of commits made by each team member.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>This graph represents the exponential number of commits made by team members as the due date of the assessment approaches.</li>
              <center><img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools11.png"></center>
              <li>These graphs represent the number of commits made by each team member. As Gesina (GSMSands) oversaw the team’s GitHub
                repository, she has contributed the most commits in this instance, from website creation to uploading of content, this can
                be seen from the number of additions and deletions she has made for this repository. Apart from that, the team’s efforts are
                reflected not only on GitHub but across all the platforms the team has used.</li>
              <center><img src="../images/tools_documentation/tools12.png"></center>
            </ol>
            <h3>Budget Hub GitHub Repository</h3>
            <p>The team used GitHub to store the code and other documents related to creating the Budget Hub prototype.
              Michail Christofis oversaw the backend and majority of the frontend for this project while Liane Wong and Gesina Sands
              contributed to some of the superficial features of the prototype.</p>

            <p>The graphs below show the significant contribution by the team’s talented member, Michail, who built the bulk of the Budget Hub application.</p>
