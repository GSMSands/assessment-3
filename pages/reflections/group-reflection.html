            <p>The structure, organization and attitude of the team was a major part of this collaboration and one which truly displayed our strength as a team. Whenever a team member had an issue or was behind on work the rest were always more than willing to help that member complete the task. Each member had the opportunity to work to the best of their abilities, with everyone focusing on each other’s strengths, in order to get the best possible results towards the groups goals. The team members on many parts of the assignment were able to work as pairs rather than individuals to achieve high levels of completion in the bigger tasks, this allowed us to form friendships within the group.
            </p>
            <p>Without a doubt, each project and collaboration will have its issues and complications, these factors weren’t absent in this particular group, especially when a member left late into the project and work wasrequired to be re-assigned. Similarly, the last project finding the most up-to-date information was a challenge. Group meetings could have been run better as most went overtime due to lack of direction and adherence to the drawn-up agenda. Communication was generally good however there is always room for improvement and some issues definitely could have been resolved in a more timely and sensitive manner.
            </p>
            <p>There were a number of factors which were rather surprising to us all of us, the largest among them being, how far we were able to get with the project idea. The ability to have an interactive and working prototype was something that seemed impossible with the short timeframe we had, however, Michail was able to go above and beyond with the back-end work creating a large collection of items and recipes for the prototype as well as interactive maps. Gesina and Liane also went above and beyond with the front-end design and user functions such as signing in and check out.
            </p>
            <p>As a group we learnt a lot about working together as a team, some of the factors that we learnt make teams succeed include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>During the first meeting the group discussed and agreed upon the goal of achieving a high distinction and that we would all put in our best effort towards this goal. This singular goal became a driving force helping everyone in the group put in their best efforts.
              </li>
              <li>Through being as candid as possible with each other we were able to cohesively work together and improve each other’s work. This taught the group that communication was a key factor towards success.
              </li>
              <li>After certain events occurred the group learnt the ability to not assume things about each other but to reach out and clarify this would again reinforce the fact that communication is one of the biggest factors towards success in a team environment.
              </li>
              <li>Another major factor in success was shown through certain members strengths in planning. Planning was shown to be the most crucial part of the project leading to the most effective use of time in later stages.
              </li>
            </ul>
