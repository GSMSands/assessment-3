            <h4>A2 Group 7 </h4>
            <p><b>Members: Gesina Sands and Liane Wong</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>A2 website:</b> <a href="https://gsmsands.github.io/fully-developed/index.html">Link to A2 website</a>
            </p>
            <p>In our previous group, we learnt a lot whilst working on assessment 2 for the ‘Introduction to Information Technology’ project. During this time, we worked closely with our group and got to know each other a lot better. Reflecting on what went well and what could be done better, we endeavour for an even stronger and cohesive group experience with our new group for assessment 3.
            </p>
            <p>We were  lucky  that  all  group  members  were  overall  very  polite  and  conscientious  towards  each  other; everyone  had  a  mature  attitude  and  were  willing  to  try  their  best  to  have  a  unified  group  experience.  Elements  that  we  can  improve  on  based  on  previous  experience  are  ensuring  that  we  have  an  open  and  honest discussion about different goals and performance expectations from the very start. Though we did have a discussion regarding this at the outset of the assessment, we were perhaps too hesitant to be as open as we may have needed to be. This later caused minor issues regarding the pace and output of work. There were  also  some  variances  in  each  person’s  idea  of  the  scope  of  the  project.  In  hindsight,  further  detailed  planning at the outset of the assessment may have helped us to avoid any scope creep as we would have been able to clearly see the work that needed to be done and to what level of detail.
            </p>
            <p>The lack of a dedicated leader and project manager of the group in assessment 2 resulted in certain group members having too many tickets and a slightly unbalanced workload. This was remedied by adopting the Kanban  board  system,  regular  assigning  of  individual  tasks,  a  master  task  list  pdf  and  sharing  the  responsibility of keeping track of agenda and minutes.
            </p>
            <p>Through the  process  of  working  together  with  our  group  in  assessment  two,  we  discovered  the  value  of  collaborating on smaller tasks. We found that this enabled us to learn and inspire each other, as well as help each  other  whilst  we  worked  on  a  particular  section  of  the  assessment.  This  enabled  us  to  have  constant  feedback from peers and resulted in higher quality work than what we produced when we were assigned tasks to do completely alone. We aim to collaborate in a similar way in assessment 3.
            </p>
            <p>As a wide gap was left by a departing team member, we decided to seek out like-minded coursemates to embark on assessment 3 with high hopes of excellence and efficiency. Through this new team, we hope to have  healthier  and  more  candid  discourse  with  a  common  goal  of  attaining  knowledge  and  achieving  outstanding results.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, we aim to have better time management and allocation of tasks as well as more detailed planning at the  outset  of  the  group  work.  We  hope  that  being  with  team  members  who  have  similar  goals  and  performance  expectations  will  lead  to  a  smoother  group  experience  with  equal  contribution  across  the  board.  We  hope  that  we  will  be  able  to  push  each  other  to  do  our  best  work  possible  in  an  inclusive  and  holistic way as well as learn from each other.
            </p>
            <h4>A2 Group 4 </h4>
            <p><b>Members: Colin Stock, Michail Christofis, Samuel Saad</b>
            </p>
            <p><b>A2 website:</b> <a href="https://michailchristofis.github.io/IT-project-2/index.html">Link to A2 website</a>
            </p>
            <p>In our previous group, we all enjoyed the general structure and organization of the team, as we felt that it was  a  major  part  of  the  collaboration  and  one  which  truly  displayed  our  strengths  as  a  team.  Moreover,  whenever  a  team  member  had  any  form  of  issue,  the  rest  were  always  more  than  willing  to  help  him  complete the task assigned to him. Furthermore, each member was given the opportunity to work to the best of their abilities, with everyone focusing on each other’s strong points to get the best possible results. In  addition,  the  consensus  is  that  as  team  members,   we  worked  more  as  a  unit  than  as  individuals,  by  allowing for us to bond well as a team and to develop into a form of family.Without a doubt, each project and collaboration will have its issues and complications, factors that weren’t absent in the assessment twogroups. We  often  underestimated  the  difficulty  as  well  as  the  tediousness  of  the  different  tasks,  and  sometimes,  were  surprised  by  the  magnitude  of  work  thathad to be completed. Certainly, finding up-to-date information and studies for use within our project also posed a great difficulty, as most of the data was outdated or generally unusable.
            </p>
            <p>There were a plethora of factors that were rather surprising to all of us, amongst them being the pleasure that we  derived  from  the  coalition  of  our  different  personalities  into  one  cohesive  mass  that  led  to  the  creation  of  a  great  project.  We  also  worked  together  with  great  effectiveness,  considering  the  different  personalities  with  which  we  were  surrounded,  to  be  as  efficient  as  possible. The  enormous number of different ideas which presented themselves, from all team members, was also surprising.
            </p>
            <p>Our determination and great versatility were crucial values that allowed for the creation of a project, which is the product of all team members respectively. We developed and cultivated our skills, throughout the duration of this project, in a multitude of different domains. We discovered the strengths of working within a group environment and leveraging the power of multiple people with different backgrounds, working on a single project. We also understood how to handle people, how to think of the benefits an application could have for the hoi polloi, and generally how to be good team members.
            </p>
            <p>Even  though  it  was  a  pleasurable  experience,  which  resulted  in  both  exceptional  work  and  the  general  betterment of the ethos of all team members, we felt it necessary to approach assessment three by forming an entirely new team. We felt that by doing so, we would be able to diversify our knowledge and experience by getting to know new team members, which undoubtedly have vastly different experiences from which we  might  benefit.  Moreover,  upon  forming  the  new  teams,  we  will  consider  all  the  valuable  lessons,  knowledge,  and  experiences,  which  we  accumulated  throughout assessment two  by  working  with  our  previous team members. In addition, we plan on implementing changes in the organisation of the group by using  applications  such  as  Kanban  to  simplify the  process  of  management  and  to  improve  the  general  organization  of  the  team.  Without  a  doubt,  our  past  experiences  will  prove  invaluable in  this  group  endeavour.
            </p>
            <h4>Assignment 3 Group Processes</h4>
            <p>Upon forming this team, each member discussed and agreed upon the desired grade to be achieved. Keeping the  grade  expectation  as  utmost  importance,  the  team  had  sought  to  derive  the  best  possible  project  management plan, priority list, and commitment level expected.
            </p>
            <p>We  have  prepared  a  team  charter  to  help  the  team  maintain  the  quality  of  work  produced  and  the collaboration process throughout this assessment period.
