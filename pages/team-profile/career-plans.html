            <p>Four of the team members from the Hex Clan remain steadfast in their
              choice of ideal jobs. This is excellent as it demonstrates confidence
              in their personal preferences. However, upon more research, one of
              the team members has decided to change their ideal job.</p>
            <h3>Liane Wong</h3>
            <p>Product Owners and Solution Architects are akin to different sides
              of the same coin. According to Conley (2020), in any organisation
              exists two metaphorical sandboxes: the business sandbox and the technology
              sandbox. Product Owners belong in the business sandbox, while Solution
              Architects belong in the technology sandbox. Initially, I believed that
              with my existing business degree, with an additional information technology
              degree, it seems fitting to choose Product Owner as my ideal job. However,
              upon closer examination of the requirements of the occupation, I have
              concluded that I have more enthusiasm for the technical aspect of projects.</p>
            <p>My research efforts in assignment two have piqued my interest, specifically
              in cybersecurity, as I realised that my personality traits, cautiousness,
              and attention-to-detail might be suitable for cybersecurity professions.
              Additionally, a global increase in demand for cybersecurity is a great
              motivating factor in my ideal job change.</p>
            <h2>Salaries and Demand</h2>
            <img src="../../images/careerplans/careerplan1.png"><br>
            <img src="../../images/careerplans/careerplan2.png"><br>
            <small><i>*Data obtained from seek.com.au- Career Advice</i></small><br>
            <small><i>*As of 26/10/2021</i></small><br>
            <p>The first bar chart displays the median salary in Australia in the
              thousands for each team member’s ideal job. The second bar chart displays
              the current job opportunities (postings) of each team member’s ideal job
              in Australia. This information was obtained from similar job titles on
              Seek.com.au – Career Advice.</p>
            <p>It appears that Security Solution Architect has the highest median salary
              of $180k per annum, followed by Senior Penetration Tester and Java Back-End
              Remote Engineer of $130k per annum, Senior Front-End Developer and lastly,
              C++ software engineer of $110k per annum.</p>
            <p>First impressions indicate that the job title ‘Security Solution Architect’
              is the most lucrative. However, considering other factors that lead to this,
              this job title will require a significant number of years in cyber security
              and general IT experience. Additionally, a master’s degree in Cybersecurity
              may be a prerequisite to attain such a position (Staff Writers 2019).
              Furthermore, Cybersecurity as an industry is experiencing unprecedented
              growth due to increasing cyberattacks globally. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers
              (PwC), Global Digital Trust Insights 2021, 55% of company executives project to
              boost their cybersecurity budgets, and at least 51% are hiring full-time
              cyber staff (Drexel 2021).</p>
            <p>A similar position to the one above is ‘Senior Penetration Tester’.
              On seek.com.au, these types of roles can be grouped together with
              ‘Security Analyst’ type roles. As elaborated above on the demand in Cybersecurity,
              these types of roles will continue to thrive. In fact, the penetration testing
              industry is projected to reach USD$3.1 billion globally by 2017 (Wood, 2021).</p>
            <p>A cursory examination suggests that the positions ‘Senior Front-End Developer’,
              ‘C++ Software Engineer’ and ‘Java Back-End Remote Engineer’ are similar in nature.
              ‘Front-End Developers’ generally prioritize user experience and user design as well
              as requiring specialization in different IT technical skills (Gallagher, 2020).
              Considering the trend of start-ups, the increase in the use of smart devices has
              fueled the demand for front-end development (Prajapati, 2020). On the other side,
              ‘C++ Software Engineer’ and ‘Java Back-End Remote Engineer’ can be considered as
              ‘Back-End Engineers’ or Developers. With back-end work, they prioritize development
              on the server-side and, at times, work on the integration of disparate systems
              (Molina, 2021). It is also reasonable to assume that with the increasing demand
              for ‘Front-End Developers’, the demand for ‘Back-End Developers or Engineers’ will
              be commensurate (Herasymova, 2021).</p>
            <p>Ultimately, all five team members have chosen in-demand vocations as
              their ideal occupation. The current job market demonstrates robust demand
              for Information Technology and Computer Science qualified wage earners. With
              the advent of increasing technologies and data consumption, one can safely
              speculate that the demand for these job titles will continue to be on-trend
              by the time all five team members graduate from their courses. However, it will
              also be prudent to guard against changing demands by being open and flexible
              to career plan changes.</p>
            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
            <img src="../../images/careerplans/techskills1.png">
            <h2>Additional Skills Needed</h2>
            <img src="../../images/careerplans/techskills2.png">
            <h2>Technical Skills Analysis</h2>
            <p>At first glance, it is obvious that the primary skills needed for all
              IT industry-related job titles are the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Microsoft Windows</li>
              <li>Building Relationships</li>
              <li>Microsoft Office</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The secondary skills needed by most IT industry-related job titles are the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>LINUX</li>
              <li>Software Engineering</li>
              <li>Git</li>
              <li>Scrum</li>
              <li>Business Process</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The two tables presented shows the technical skills different job titles require.
              In the first table, the rows rank the skills in demand for IT jobs in 2018 from top to bottom.
              It is observed that the different job titles require different selections of skills. However,
              it is interesting to note that two job titles, ‘C++ Software Engineer’ and ‘Java Back-End
              Remote Engineer’, have somewhat similar technical skill requirements.</p>
            <h2>Career Paths for Personality Types</h2>
            <img src="../../images/careerplans/personalities.png"><br>
            <p>Across all five members of the Hex Clan, two personality types are observed.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Logistician Personality (ISTJ-A /ISTJ-T)</li>
              <li>Architect Personality (INTJ-A /INTJ-T)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For Colin Stock, who has a ‘Logistician’ personality, it has been
              recommended that careers such as military officers, lawyers, judges,
              police officers and detectives are suitable. This is partly in reason
              with their strong principles and reliability. Colin chose ‘Senior Penetration
              Tester’ as his ideal job, which would fall in the same league as the recommended
              careers as a preference for law and order can indicate a natural inclination to
              sense potential malicious attacks and loopholes in software systems
              (NERIS Analytics Limited, n.d.).</p>
            <p>Four team members: Gesina Sands, Liane Wong, Michail Christofis and Samuel Saad,
              presented as ‘Architect’ personalities which is remarkable as problem-solving and
              rationality are distinct personality traits for this personality type. Examples of
              recommended careers for this personality are computer programmer, software engineer,
              computer systems analyst or technical writer. It is evident why these four team
              members have chosen their ideal jobs (Woods, 2020). The innate ability to comprehend
              complex principles and translate them into overt and actionable strategies can enable
              this personality type to be excellent in their chosen ideal jobs (NERIS Analytics
              Limited, n.d.).</p>
            <h2>Career Plan Details</h2>
            <p>The team has completed a career path plan to visualise their goals.</p>


            <iframe src="../../resources/team_career_plan.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0" width="80%" height = 1000em></iframe>


            <p>When looking at the career plans across the group, we see that three of the group members
              have chosen software engineering roles, and two members have chosen roles within the
              security field. Looking at all the data, we can see that all these roles will need us
              to have solid analytical skills, problem-solving skills, research skills as well as
              some management skills. When evaluating target skills that everyone is striving towards,
              similarities that appear are skills concerned with working in a team environment as well
              as effective conflict resolution. Looking through everyone’s soft skills, it is evident
              that well-rounded IT professionals who excel in their field need to be hard-working,
              creative and have good interpersonal skills to succeed in the workplace.</p>
            <p>Everyone’s future career plans require formal education as well as extra IT certification
              to help stand out when looking for work. Furthermore, certain roles such as Security
              Solution Architect as chosen by Liane require completion of a master’s degree to be able
              to work in her chosen specialization. Michail has also indicated that in his career plan,
              he will be working towards the completion of a master’s degree to further increase
              his knowledge and job prospects. Colin's career plan as Cybersecurity Penetration Tester
              requires a considerable number of certifications compared to some of the other career
              plans to stand out from the crowd. Gesina and Samuels career plans upon completion of
              undergraduate study are focused on skills in the workplace as well as keeping up to date
              with relevant certifications in the industry.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, though we have all chosen different roles, the pathway to those roles is
              very similar in that we need formal education, we need critical thinking and problem-solving
              skills as well as creativity. We need emotional intelligence and excellent interpersonal skills
              to thrive in the workplace, and we need to have a dedicated and diligent approach to our studies
              and work to be able to succeed in our career plans.</p>
