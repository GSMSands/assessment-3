            <h4>Topic</h4>
            <p>The  Hex  Clan’s  project  idea  is  to  create  a  multipurpose  application  to  assist  its  users  in  obtaining  the  best  prices for groceries locally and to navigate efficiently to specific stores with users chosen products. Initially, the  motivation  for  creating  this  app  was  to  aid  people  of  low  socio-economic  status  to  afford  and  plan  delicious  meals  as  well  as  help  them  keep  track  of  their  spending  habits  through  budgeting.  The  app  was  then  expanded  to  include  local  shopping,  as  in  recent  years,   online  shopping  has  become  more  popular  largely due to convenience and competitive prices. Online shopping has disrupted the local economy in small towns and capital cities alike. Hence our team wanted to create an app to help solve these problems with a tangible solution.
            </p>
            <p>The key features of this app will include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Comprehensive Product List –</b> Displays products stores have in stock, their live prices, and when sales are on. (This can be done by scraping data from the store’s websites, with the use of web automation like Selenium in Python, and for stores without websites, this can be done by having them send data files to the administrators of the app, who will manually transfer the data into the app's database) In the future according to (Ltd n.d.) with Redgate Deploy we can automate this database process, there is also a variety of Redgate tools for us to utilise.
              </li>
              <li><b>Route Planning –</b> This  app  will  help  determine  the  order  of  stores  to  visit,  using  an  API  tool  like  (Google  n.d.)  Google  OR-Tools,  and  will  take  traffic  into  account.  This  app  will  choose  the  most  efficient route to several shops. This will then be displayed to the user to advise them of the fastest, most efficient route to visit the shops they have chosen products from.
              </li>
              <li><b>Budgeting –</b> The app will display the estimated price after the user adds their shopping into the ‘cart.’ Future  updates  will  add  new  features,  including  the  scanning  feature,  which  will  allow  the  user  to track the products as they buy them by scanning the bar code or the item itself (using a back-end tool like Google ML Kit or Google Cloud Vision) (manual entry will also be available) this will track their actual  spending  and  display  their  spending  over  time  in  a  bar  graph  that  will  also  help  them  with budgeting. This feature of the application will also display overall savings and spending on items over a week.
              </li>
              <li><b>Meal Planning –</b> This  app  will  also  have  the  ability  to  store  recipes  with  ingredients  required  for  a  broad range of easy to make meals. This will allow the user to search for meals and easily find the ingredients and how much they cost with a total meal cost displayed for them.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project will be designed as a one-stop-shop that facilitates shopping, meal planning and budgeting into one easy to use app.
            </p>
            <p>The desired goal of this app will be in giving users the ability and opportunity to minimise their weekly spending without compromising their quality of life. This will be achieved by helping users purchase only what they require. According to (Caeser 2019),  it is important to make a shopping list to reduce the chances of impulse buying. Some of the additional benefits of having a shopping list include saving money, time, and energy, reducing waste, helping with keeping you focused, helping improve your memory and making you feel good when you complete it. With regards to food, the user will be able to accurately purchase only the ingredients they need to create the meals they plan to make. Also, with the apps ability to notify users when sale periods are happening, people will be able to buy products that they may not often purchase at lower prices,  helping them with budgeting.
            </p>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>Due to the challenge of finding exact products in local shops,  as well as not being able to find products at the best possible price, online sales have been and are increasing dramatically (Kristensen 2021, para.7.). This shift in the consumer market towards online shopping may be affecting local businesses. In fact, according to (Plastow 2019),  Australia’s smaller cities and regional towns are losing their shopping districts as online shopping continues to trend upwards. The number of Australians who are shopping online increased 20.2% year on year in 2018. This trend is further exacerbated in “inner regional” towns such as Toowoomba and Ballarat,  with these areas seeing increases in online shopping of up to 21.4% in the same period.
            </p>
            <p>According  to  Aguirre  (2020),  the  meteoric  rise  of  online  shopping  has  presented  both  challenges  and  opportunities  for  local  companies  to  accomplish  their  vital  task  of  receiving  the  attention  and  business  of  their  target  audiences.  E-commerce  can  bring  some  negative  impacts  to  local  economies,  the  biggest  negative impact being the reduction in the amount of sales tax and other local taxes that local governments collect.
            </p>
            <p>Online sales also make it hard for local stores to have a competitive advantage with their prices as online sources often do not charge sales tax. The difference with small purchases may be negligible; however,  this can add up on larger buys. Having customers choose to go online will also restrict local company’s growth rates. Online purchases from conglomerate retailers like Amazon can also drain the local economy further by  reducing  growth  in  the  immediate  community.  This  can  cause  a  vicious  cycle  where  local  retailers  are  unable to compete with larger companies. This,  in turn, causes companies in the area to hire fewer people and or to increase their prices to stay afloat and profitable. The local economy suffers as a result as there is less money circulating in the immediate area, causing fewer opportunities for growth and jobs.
            </p>
            <p>Working on this project will provide valuable experience in working on an IT project as part of a team. We will have the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in a variety of front-end and back-end tools. As well as gaining experience in web design, mobile design, and database structures. This will help our team stand out when we advance into the workforce rather than just an average university graduate. Working in a team will help improve skills like time management, decision making, collaboration, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and project management. These skills, according to (Omoth, 2020) are in the top 13 job skills employers want in 2021.

            <h4> Landscape </h4>
            <p>According  to  (Bourne,  2021)  some  of  the  top  grocery  shopping  apps  and  how  our  app  is  unique  when  compared to them include:
            </p>
            <p><b>Similar Products and Points of Difference</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Key Ring –</b> This app stores the user’s loyalty cards on their mobile device, giving them access to programs and coupons. They are also able to browse store sales and create shopping lists. Whilst our app doesn’t store their loyalty cards or provide special mobile coupons, the user can browse stores sales, create shopping lists as well as utilise features like budgeting, meal planning and route planning.
              </li>
              <li><b>Aisle411 –</b> The  iOS  app  maps  store  aisles  giving  the  user  the  quickest  route  in-store  to  what  they  need.  Although this app may overlap in users, our app has far more generic use with budgeting, meal planning, route planning and more.
              </li>
              <li><b>Listonic –</b> Capable of making multiple lists that update while the user shops, archive,  and share their lists and add prices of their products. Whilst similar to our app and creating better shopping lists, Listonic does not have nearly as many functions as ours with the extra functionality of budgeting, meal planning, route planning and a database of recipes, items and costs.
              </li>
              <li><b>ZipList –</b> Keeps  grocery  lists  and  coupons  together  as  well  as pulling  needed  ingredients  for  recipes,  storing  the recipes, and making suggestions on favourites. Our app is more capable, with the ability to track spending and suggest routes to make the shopping trip shorter.
              </li>
              <li><b>Pushpins –</b> This allows the creation of grocery lists, recipe browsing and clipping of digital coupons. This app also  allows  the  user  to  discover  weekly  specials.  Our  app  does  this  and  more,  allowing  budget  tracking  and  quicker commutes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our research showed that though most apps had similar functions to our app, none of the competitors had all  the  features  working  seamlessly  in  a  single  app.  Our  app’s  aim  is  to  function  as  the  only  app  you  will  require for all your budgeting, shopping, and bargain hunting needs.
            </p>
